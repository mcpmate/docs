## Auto-Detection

MCPMate scans your system for supported applications:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cursor" icon="code">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Claude Desktop" icon="message-circle">

  <Card title="Zed" icon="zap">
    High-performance collaborative code editor
  </Card>
  <Card title="..." icon="cherry">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Connections

For each detected app, you can:

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle MCP integration on or off
- **View Status**: See connection health and last activity
- **Configure**: Set app-specific proxy settings
- **Redirect**: Choose which configuration suit to use

<Callout type="info">
  Apps must be restarted after enabling/disabling MCP integration in MCPMate.
</Callout>

## Manual Configuration

If your app isn't auto-detected:

1. Click **Add Custom App**
2. Specify the application name and MCP configuration method
3. Choose connection type (stdio, SSE, or HTTP)
4. Test the connection

- **HTTP**: RESTful API communication

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **App not detected**: Ensure it's installed in standard locations
- **Connection failed**: Check app permissions and firewall settings
