## What are Config Suits?

A configuration suit is a named collection of:
- MCP servers and their settings
- Enabled tools and their priorities
- Prompt libraries and templates
- Resource access permissions

Think of suits as "profiles" that you can switch between instantly.

## Default Suits

MCPMate ships with several pre-configured suits:

    Development-focused servers and tools
  </Card>
  <Card title="Writer" icon="pen-tool">
    Content creation and research tools
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
