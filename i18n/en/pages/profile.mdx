## What is Profile?

A profile is a named collection of:
- MCP servers and their settings
- Enabled tools and their priorities
- Prompt libraries and templates
- Resource access permissions

Think of profile as presets that you can switch between instantly.

## Default Profile

MCPMate ships with several pre-configured profile:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Default" icon="home">
    Basic MCP tools for general use
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coder" icon="code">
    Development-focused servers and tools
  </Card>
  <Card title="Writer" icon="pen-tool">
    Content creation and research tools
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
