## What are Tools?

In MCP, tools are functions that:
- **Execute operations**: Perform specific tasks like file operations, API calls, or calculations
- **Accept parameters**: Use JSON Schema to define input requirements
- **Return structured results**: Provide text or binary content back to the LLM
- **Enable real-world actions**: Allow LLMs to interact with external systems

Tools are discovered through `tools/list` requests and invoked via `tools/call` requests.

## Managing Tools

### Enable/Disable Tools
- Toggle individual tools on or off
- Tools are grouped by their parent server
- Disabled tools won't appear in client applications
- Changes take effect immediately

### Tool Priorities
When multiple tools have similar functions:
- Set priority levels (High, Normal, Low)
- Higher priority tools are suggested first
- Helps resolve conflicts between similar capabilities

### Tool Configuration
Some tools accept configuration parameters:
- **Rate limits**: Requests per minute/hour
- **Timeouts**: Maximum execution time
- **Default parameters**: Pre-filled values for common use cases

<Callout type="info">
  Tool availability depends on your active configuration suit. Switch suits to access different tool sets.
</Callout>

## Tool Conflicts

When tools from different servers provide similar functionality:

1. **Automatic resolution**: MCPMate suggests the highest-priority tool
2. **Manual override**: You can specify which tool to use
3. **Conflict indicators**: Visual warnings when conflicts exist

## Custom Tools

Advanced users can:
- Create custom tool wrappers
- Combine multiple tools into workflows
- Set up tool aliases for easier access
- Configure tool-specific authentication

## Monitoring Tool Usage

Track tool performance:
- **Execution count**: How often each tool is used
- **Success rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Average response time**: Performance metrics
- **Error logs**: Failed execution details
