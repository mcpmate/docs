## Pain points today

- **Repetitive setup** – every MCP-compatible editor (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Zed…) must be configured separately.
- **Resource waste** – running multiple server instances consumes CPU and memory.
- **Context switching** – changing projects or workflows means starting/stopping servers and hand-editing configs.
